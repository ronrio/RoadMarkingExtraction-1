Parameters Notification
1 road_type ï¼ˆ1: highway, 2: urban road) default: 2
2 point_density (expected average point density on road surface, X point/m^2) default: 900.0
3 grid_resolution (projected grid size [unit:m]) default: 0.1
4 intensity_scale (controls the value range of point intensity. Generally, the smaller the value is, the more markings are found, and the more noise are found accordingly). recommended: 2.0-8.0, default: 5.0
5 density_threshold (describes the approximate number of ground points in a single pixel on the road) recommended: 2.0-5.0, default: 2.5
6 rotation_increment_step  (controls the increase step size of the initial estimate of the rotation angle during template matching. The larger the value, the more robust the template matching, but the longer time it would take) recommended: 15-45, default: 25.0
7 matching_fitness_thre (controls the error threshold during template matching. The larger the value, the lower the accuracy and the higher the recall) preferred: 0.01-0.05, default: 0.02
8 overlaping_distance_thre (controls the search radius [unit:m] of neighboring points when calculating the template matching overlap ratio. The larger the value, the higher the overlap ratio would be) recommended: 0.1-0.2 default: 0.15
9 overlaping_ratio_thre (controls the criterion for judging that the template matching is successful, that is, the overlapping ratio between the template model and the scene point cloud. The larger this value is, the corresponding matching accuracy would be higher and the recall would be lower) recommended: 0.7-0.8 default: 0.75
10 sideline_vector_distance (controls the distance threshold [unit: m] for vectorization of long edges. Adjacent edges whose endpoint distance is less than this threshold will be connected into a segment; in addition, the vectorized sampling points will also use this value as the sampling interval) recommended: 3.0-6.0 default: 4.5
11 visualization_on (1:on, 0:off) default: 0
